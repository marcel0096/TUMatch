# TUMatch - a hyperlocal matching platform

Welcome to our web application that we created in the SEBA Master course at TUM.
The application provides a platform where student co-founder and other students can match up to form a startup.

The application is based on the MERN stack and uses bootstrap react components for styling.
For payment services we use Stripe as payment provider. To make the payment provider work in a local environment, you need to create a local strip webhook.


## Running the application in Docker
If you want to test the payment functionality as well, conduct the stripe setup, before containerization of the project.
### 1. Containerize project
Navigate to root of repository and execute ```docker compose build```
### 2. Run containerized project
After successfull containerization, start the application using: ```docker compose up```
You can now locally access the frontend of the webapplication under: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
(Database access is already provided by the mongoDbUrl attribute in the [config.js](/backend/config.js) that contains login information)

## Running the application locally
### 1 Install packages
Run  ```npm install ``` in the frontend and the backend directory, as both of them represent standalone react projects.

### 2 Start application
Run ```npm start``` in the frontend and the backend directory to start the backend server and the frontend service.
You can now locally access the frontend of the webapplication under: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Test user
If you quickly want to check some features, you can use our example student and example investor. The investor already has a valid subscription via stripe, so if you donÂ´t want to set up stripe, just use the example investor user.
